Hi! My name is Nicholas Bering, and I've been working professionally as a Software
Engineer since 2015. Before that, I was programming solo for projects that helped
me personally, or in my business and work roles.

I don't usually write about my work projects directly, but I do like to write about
technology in a general sense. And especially my passion projects.
